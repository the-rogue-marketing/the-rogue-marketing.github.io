# OpenAI API Pricing Update: October 2025 Overview

*October 2025*

OpenAI continues to expand its model lineup with more specialized options and competitive pricing. Here's a breakdown of the latest API pricing effective October 2025.

## GPT-5 Series: Three Tiers for Every Need

### GPT-5
- **Best for**: Coding and agentic tasks across industries
- **Capabilities**: Text & vision, reasoning, all built-in tools
- **Context**: 400k context length | 128k max output tokens
- **Pricing**: Input: $125 | Output: $10.00 per 1M tokens

### GPT-5 mini
- **Best for**: Faster, cheaper version for well-defined tasks
- **Capabilities**: Text & vision, reasoning, all built-in tools
- **Context**: 400k context length | 128k max output tokens
- **Pricing**: Input: $0.25 | Output: $2.00 per 1M tokens

### GPT-5 nano
- **Best for**: Fastest, cheapest versionâ€”great for summarization and classification
- **Capabilities**: Text & vision, reasoning, all built-in tools
- **Context**: 400k context length | 128k max output tokens
- **Pricing**: Input: $0.05 | Output: $0.40 per 1M tokens

## Realtime API: Low-Latency Multimodal Experiences

Build realtime experiences including speech-to-speech with these rates:

### Text Processing
- **gpt-realtime**: $4.00 / 1M input tokens | $0.40 / 1M cached input tokens | $16.00 / 1M output tokens
- **GPT-4o mini**: $0.60 / 1M input tokens | $0.30 / 1M cached input tokens | $2.40 / 1M output tokens

### Audio Processing
- **gpt-realtime**: $32.00 / 1M input tokens | $0.40 / 1M cached input tokens | $64.00 / 1M output tokens
- **GPT-4o mini**: $10.00 / 1M input tokens | $0.30 / 1M cached input tokens | $20.00 / 1M output tokens

### Image Processing
- **gpt-realtime**: $5.00 / 1M input tokens | $0.50 / 1M cached input tokens

## Image Generation API

Precise, high-fidelity image generation and editing:

- **Text Input**: $5.00 / 1M tokens | $1.25 / 1M cached tokens*
- **Image Input**: $10.00 / 1M tokens | $2.50 / 1M cached tokens* | $40.00 / 1M output tokens

*Image output costs*:
- Low quality: ~$0.01 per square image
- Medium quality: ~$0.04 per square image  
- High quality: ~$0.17 per square image

*\*available via the Responses API*

## Built-in Tools Pricing

Extend model capabilities with these additional tools:

- **Code Interpreter**: $0.03 per session
- **File Search Storage**: $0.10 / GB per day (first GB free)
- **File Search Tool Call**: $2.50 / 1k calls (Responses API only)

### Web Search Pricing
- **Web search preview** (gpt-4o, gpt-4.i, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.i-mini): $25.00 / 1K calls
- **Web search preview** (gpt-5, o-series): $10.00 / 1K calls
- **Web search** (all models): $10.00 / 1K calls

*Note: Search content tokens are free for gpt-4o and gpt-4.i models with web search preview*

## Cost Optimization Options

Pricing reflects standard processing rates. To optimize cost and performance for different use cases, we also offer:

- **Batch API**: Save 50% on inputs and outputs with the Batch API and run tasks asynchronously over 24 hours
- **Priority Processing**: Offers reliable, high-speed performance with the flexibility to pay-as-you-go

## Key Takeaways

1. **More Tiered Options**: GPT-5 series now offers three distinct tiers for different use cases and budgets
2. **Specialized APIs**: Realtime and Image Generation APIs provide dedicated pricing for specific modalities
3. **Cost Optimization**: Multiple ways to reduce costs through caching, batch processing, and choosing the right model tier
4. **Transparent Tool Pricing**: Clear pricing for built-in tools like Code Interpreter and File Search

Choose the right model and optimization strategy based on your specific needs around latency, cost, and task complexity.
